# schrift TODOs
The following bullet points are listed in no particular order.

## Bugs
- There might still be situations in which the asserts inside `decode_contours` get triggered.
  This should never happen and points to a bug somewhere in the outline decoder.
- The proportion of left and right horizontal spacing around some characters in monospace fonts
  is weirdly of balance. Reproducable with the character 'X' and any of the following fonts:
  B612Mono-Regular.ttf, CamingoCode-Regular.ttf, CourierPrime-Regular.ttf, NotoMono-Regular.ttf, UbuntuMono-Regular.ttf

## Features
- Kerning needs to be tested.
- `sftdemo` needs a better sample text. The one I planned on using is apparently copyrighted ...
- `stress` should render a large range of code points to be more representative.
- `sftdemo`'s use of `aa_tree` *might* be a major performance bottleneck. If that's the case,
  we will need another algorithm / datastructure / strategy for loading code point ranges.
- `sftdemo` should operate on a hierarchy of fonts, since nowadays most fonts aren't monolithic files anymore.
- We need an interface to check if a font is monospace.
- We will probably need user-defined transformations for slanted text etc.
- `sftdemo` should probably make use of kerning.
- We need an interface for subpixel rendering.
  Mattias Andr√©e already proposed a possible API for this!
- There are some kerning features like minimum values that are not yet supported.
- There are some compound glyph features like grid-snapping that are not yet supported.

## Documentation
- Fill in missing sections and paragraphs in the man page.
- Example snippets in the man page.
- The `sft_kerning` function has to be documented, preferably in the man page.
- The inner workings of `sftdemo` have to be better documented, as it is meant to be example code.
