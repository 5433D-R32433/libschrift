# schrift To-Do's
The following bullet points are listed in no particular order.

## Bugs

## Features
- Kerning needs to be tested.
- `sftdemo` needs a better sample text. The one I planned on using is apparently copyrighted ...
- `stress` should render a large range of code points to be more representative.
- `sftdemo`'s use of `aa_tree` *might* be a major performance bottleneck. If that's the case,
  we will need another algorithm / datastructure / strategy for loading code point ranges.
- We will probably need user-defined transformations for slanted text etc.
- `sftdemo` should probably make use of kerning.
- We need an interface for subpixel rendering.
  Mattias Andr√©e already proposed a possible API for this!
- There are some kerning features like minimum values that are not yet supported.
- There are some compound glyph features like grid-snapping that are not yet supported.
- We need an interface to support using an entire priority / codepoint-range based stack of fonts.
  For the longest time, I thought this could be done by a text shaping library sitting on top of schrift.
  Now I'm starting to see that it would be much more beneficial to implement this directly within libschrift.

## Documentation
- Fill in missing sections and paragraphs in the man page.
- Example snippets in the man page.
- The `sft_kerning` function has to be documented, preferably in the man page.
- The inner workings of `sftdemo` have to be better documented, as it is meant to be example code.

## Code Quality
- Refactor `simple_outline`
- Refactor `tesselate_curves`
- `transform_points` probably should take the outline as the primary argument.
- `clip_points` probably should take the outline as the primary argument.
- Perhaps rename `struct buffer` to `struct raster` again?
- The following new functions to map array problems to single instance problems:
  * `decode_contours` / `decode_contour`
- Consider internally switching to Q16.16 fixnums for most rational number representations.
- Replace usage of overly specific integer sizes (`uint16_t` etc.) with slightly
  more malleable ones. Either builtin integer types or ones of the form `uint_least16_t`.
- Remove implicit integer conversions. They can be a source of major trouble.
