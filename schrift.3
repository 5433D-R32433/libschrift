.Sh DESCRIPTION

.Fn sft_version
can be used to determine which version of
.Nm
you are using. Since
.Nm
uses semantic versioning, the returned string will usually be of the form
.Qq MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
\&.

.Ss The SFT structure

.Bd -literal
struct SFT {
	SFT_Font *font;
	double xScale;
	double yScale;
	double x;
	double y;
	unsigned int flags;
};
.Ed

.Ss The SFT_Char structure
.Fn sft_char
returns all relevant information except status code in a struct SFT_Char.
.Bd -literal
struct SFT_Char {
	void *image;
	double advance;
	int x;
	int y;
	int width;
	int height;
};
.Ed

The fields are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 8
.It Va image
An 8-bit grayscale image without any padding, so each byte corresponds to one pixel.
The colors are inverse to what you would expect: Text is always drawn white on black.
That's because this way it's really convenient to use the image as an alpha mask.
This is also the reason why the image isn't gamma corrected.
This field only gets set if the flag
.Dv SFT_RENDER_IMAGE
was set.
In this case, it is the caller's duty to later release the image's memory again by calling
.Fn free .
.It Va x
The X offset in pixels that should be applied to the image.
.It Va y
The Y offset in pixels that should be applied to the image.
The flag
.Dv SFT_DOWNWARD_Y
controls the orientation of the coordinate system that this field is relative to.
.It Va width
The width of the image in pixels.
This field gets set even if
.Dv SFT_RENDER_IMAGE
was not set.
.It Va height
The height of the image in pixels.
This field gets set even if
.Dv SFT_RENDER_IMAGE
was not set.

.Sh RETURN VALUES

.Fn sft_loadmem
and
.Fn sft_loadfile
return NULL on error.
.Fn sft_linemetrics
and
.Fn sft_char
return 0 on success or -1 on error.

.Sh EXAMPLES

See the source code of
.Sy sftdemo
for a detailed example of real-world usage of
.Nm .

.Sh CAVEATS

The only text encoding that
.Nm
understands is Unicode.
Similarly, the only kind of font file supported right now
are TrueType (.ttf) fonts (Some OpenType fonts might work too,
as OpenType is effectively a superset of TrueType).
.Nm
currently does not implement font hinting and probably never will.
